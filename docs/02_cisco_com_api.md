# Go on a Magic Carpet Ride 

Update the API Credentials file with your keys and secrets. It is a good idea to use Secret Strings and encrypt the secrets. 

    APIs:
        recommended_release:
            recommended_release_api_username: {{ your key here }}
            recommended_release_api_password: {{ your secret here }}
        serial_2_info:
            serial_2_info_api_username: {{ your key here }}
            serial_2_info_api_password: {{ your secret here }}
        psirt:
            psirt_api_username: {{ your key here }}
            psirt_api_password: {{ your secret here }}

Update the testbed_cisco_api.yaml to reflect your topology and devices. 

Run the pyATS job

```console
pyats run job Cisco_API_magic_carpet_job.py --testbed-file testbed/testbed_cisco_api.yaml
```
